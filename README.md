## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning process in LaTeX, providing examples ranging from basic documents to more structured and styled templates.

## Usage

Each, here mentioned, folder contains a specific LaTeX project with its own README.md with descriptions.

Feel free to explore these projects to get started with LaTeX and understand different LaTeX capabilities.

## Getting Started with LaTeX

For those new to LaTeX, the concepts of engines, packages, and overall structure can seem complex. A great starting point is the [LaTeX tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmagZthwhaY), which provides a beginner-friendly introduction to setup LaTeX on Visual Studio Code.

## About LaTeX

### Basic Principles of LaTeX
- **Typesetting System** LaTeX is a typesetting system ideal for structured documents, particularly those with mathematical content. It extends TeX, a foundational typesetting system.
- **Compiled Nature**: Unlike word processors, LaTeX documents are written in plain text files and then compiled into a formatted document, typically PDF.
- **TeX Engine**: LaTeX uses a TeX engine in the background for compilation, transforming the text and commands into a high-quality document.

### LaTeX Commands and Environments
- **Commands** in LaTeX start with a backslash `\` and can include required `{}` and optional `[]` arguments.
- **Environments**, marked by `\begin` and `\end`, define document sections with specific behavior, like `figure` or `table`.
- **Comments**: In LaTeX, line comments start with `%`, allowing annotations or deactivation of code without execution.

### Command Examples
LaTeX provides a variety of commands and macros for customizing and enhancing document design. Here are a few examples:

- **Font Styles**: LaTeX offers commands like `\textbf` for bold text, `\textit` for italic text, and `\texttt` for monospaced text.
- **Mathematical Symbols**: LaTeX provides commands for mathematical symbols, such as `\alpha` for α, `\beta` for β, and `\sum` for ∑.
- **Lists**: LaTeX offers commands for creating different types of lists, such as `\itemize` for bullet points and `\enumerate` for numbered lists.
- **Tables**: LaTeX provides commands for creating tables, such as `\begin{tabular}` and `\end{tabular}`, allowing you to define the structure and content of the table.
- **Figures**: LaTeX offers commands for including figures, such as `\includegraphics`, allowing you to insert images into your document.
- **Custom Commands**: LaTeX provides the `\newcommand` macro for creating custom commands, streamlining complex tasks and enhancing document design flexibility.

These are just a few examples of the many commands and macros available in LaTeX. They allow you to customize various aspects of your document and create complex structures with ease.

### Definitions
- **TeX Primitives** are low-level, foundational commands in TeX for tasks like setting fonts and defining dimensions.
- **LaTeX Macros** are higher-level commands, often consisting of TeX primitives, designed for ease of use, like the commands mentioned in the previous section.
- **Custom macros** are created using `\newcommand`, streamlining complex tasks and enhancing document creation efficiency.

### Understanding the Interplay of Tex Primitives and LaTeX Macros
- LaTeX abstracts the complexity of TeX primitives into user-friendly macros, making it more accessible while retaining the power of TeX for advanced users.

### Packages in LaTeX
- Packages in LaTeX are collections of additional commands and features that extend the functionality of LaTeX.
- They are included in a document using the `\usepackage` command.
- Packages cover a wide range of functionalities, such as adding graphics, formatting tables, or typesetting mathematical equations.
- Popular packages include `graphicx`, `amsmath`, and `hyperref`.
- Note: When including a package in LaTeX, it may come with default settings that can change the page layout or font style, providing a predefined configuration!


This overview provides insights into LaTeX's command structure, custom command creation, and the role of environments and macros, showcasing the system's versatility for document creation.
