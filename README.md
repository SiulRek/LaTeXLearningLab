## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning process in LaTeX, providing examples ranging from basic documents to more structured and styled templates.

## Usage

Each, here mentioned, folder contains a specific LaTeX project with its own README.md with descriptions.

Feel free to explore these projects to get started with LaTeX and understand different LaTeX capabilities.

## Getting Started with LaTeX

For those new to LaTeX, the concepts of engines, packages, and overall structure can seem complex. A great starting point is the [LaTeX tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmagZthwhaY), which provides a beginner-friendly introduction to setup LaTeX on Visual Studio Code.

## About LaTeX

### Basic Principles of LaTeX
- LaTeX is a typesetting system ideal for structured documents, particularly those with mathematical content. It extends TeX, a foundational typesetting system.

### LaTeX Commands and Environments
- Commands in LaTeX start with a backslash `\` and can include required `{}` and optional `[]` arguments.
- Environments, marked by `\begin` and `\end`, define document sections with specific behavior, like `figure` or `table`.

### Command Definitions
- LaTeX provides commands like `\definecolor` to customize aspects such as color.
- The `\newcommand` macro simplifies the creation of complex commands, enhancing document design flexibility.

### TeX Primitives and Macros
- **TeX Primitives** are low-level, foundational commands in TeX for tasks like setting fonts and defining dimensions.
- **LaTeX Macros** are higher-level commands, often consisting of TeX primitives, designed for ease of use, like `\section`.
- Custom macros are created using `\newcommand`, streamlining complex tasks and enhancing document creation efficiency.

### Understanding the Interplay
- LaTeX abstracts the complexity of TeX primitives into user-friendly macros, making it more accessible while retaining the power of TeX for advanced users.

### Packages in LaTeX
- Packages in LaTeX are collections of additional commands and features that extend the functionality of LaTeX.
- They are included in a document using the `\usepackage` command.
- Packages cover a wide range of functionalities, such as adding graphics, formatting tables, or typesetting mathematical equations.
- Popular packages include `graphicx`, `amsmath`, and `hyperref`.
- Note: When including a package in LaTeX, it may come with default settings that can change the page layout or font style, providing a predefined configuration!


This overview provides insights into LaTeX's command structure, custom command creation, and the role of environments and macros, showcasing the system's versatility for document creation.
