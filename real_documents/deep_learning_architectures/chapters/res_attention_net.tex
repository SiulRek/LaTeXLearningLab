\chapter{Residual Attention Network}

\section{Description}
The Residual Attention Network is a convolutional neural network that integrates attention mechanisms with residual connections. This architecture leverages attention modules to focus on salient features of the input while preserving the benefits of deep residual learning. It is especially effective in handling complex tasks like image classification and object detection.

\section{Python Implementation}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def residual_unit(input, filters):
    x = layers.BatchNormalization()(input)
    x = layers.Activation('relu')(x)
    x = layers.Conv2D(filters, 3, padding='same')(x)

    x = layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = layers.Activation('relu')(x)
    x = layers.Conv2D(filters, 3, padding='same')(x)

    x = layers.add([x, input])
    return x

def attention_module(input, filters):
    # Trunk branch
    trunk = residual_unit(input, filters)
    trunk = residual_unit(trunk, filters)

    # Soft mask branch
    mask = layers.Conv2D(filters, 1, activation='relu')(input)
    mask = layers.MaxPooling2D(2)(mask)
    mask = residual_unit(mask, filters)
    mask = layers.UpSampling2D(2)(mask)
    mask = layers.Conv2D(filters, 1, activation='sigmoid')(mask)

    x = layers.multiply([trunk, mask])
    x = layers.add([x, input])
    return x

input = layers.Input(shape=(224, 224, 3))
x = layers.Conv2D(64, 7, strides=2, padding='same', activation='relu')(input)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D(3, strides=2, padding='same')(x)

# Stack attention modules
x = attention_module(x, 64)
x = attention_module(x, 128)
x = attention_module(x, 256)

x = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
output = layers.Dense(1000, activation='softmax')(x)

model = models.Model(inputs=input, outputs=output)

\section{Comments}
The Residual Attention Network is notable for its innovative combination of attention mechanisms with residual learning, allowing for more nuanced and focused feature extraction. Its ability to emphasize important features while suppressing less relevant information makes it a strong contender in various computer vision tasks.
