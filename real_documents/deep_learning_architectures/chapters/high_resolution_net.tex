\chapter{High-Resolution Network (HRNet)}

\section{Description}
High-Resolution Network (HRNet) is a powerful neural network architecture primarily used for tasks requiring high-resolution feature maps, such as semantic segmentation and human pose estimation. Unlike traditional methods that downsample images to a low resolution and then upsample, HRNet maintains high-resolution representations through the network, allowing it to capture more precise spatial information.

\section{Python Implementation}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def hrnet_block(input, num_channels):
    x = layers.Conv2D(num_channels, 3, padding='same', use_bias=False)(input)
    x = layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = layers.ReLU()(x)
    x = layers.Conv2D(num_channels, 3, padding='same', use_bias=False)(x)
    x = layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = layers.add([input, x])
    x = layers.ReLU()(x)
    return x

def create_hrnet():
    inputs = layers.Input(shape=(256, 256, 3))
    x = layers.Conv2D(64, 3, strides=2, padding='same')(inputs)
    x = layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = layers.ReLU()(x)

    x = hrnet_block(x, 64)
    x = layers.Conv2D(128, 3, strides=2, padding='same')(x)
    x_highres = hrnet_block(x, 128)

    # Low resolution path
    x_lowres = layers.Conv2D(256, 3, strides=2, padding='same')(x_highres)
    x_lowres = hrnet_block(x_lowres, 256)

    # Upsampling and merging
    x_lowres_upsampled = layers.UpSampling2D(size=(2, 2))(x_lowres)
    merged = layers.concatenate([x_lowres_upsampled, x_highres])

    # Final layers
    x = hrnet_block(merged, 128)
    x = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
    outputs = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

    model = models.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
    return model

model = create_hrnet()
\end{lstlisting}
