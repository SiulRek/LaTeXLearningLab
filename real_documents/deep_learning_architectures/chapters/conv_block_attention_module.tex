\chapter{Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM)}

\section{Description}
The Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is an attention mechanism that can be integrated into convolutional neural networks. It sequentially infers attention maps along two dimensions: channel and spatial, thereby refining feature maps for improved model performance. CBAM is versatile and can be added to various CNN architectures to enhance their feature learning capabilities.

\section{Python Implementation}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def channel_attention(input_feature, ratio=8):
    channel = input_feature.shape[-1]
    shared_layer = layers.Dense(channel//ratio, activation='relu')

    avg_pool = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(input_feature)
    avg_pool = shared_layer(layers.Reshape((1, channel))(avg_pool))
    avg_pool = layers.Dense(channel, activation='sigmoid')(avg_pool)

    max_pool = layers.GlobalMaxPooling2D()(input_feature)
    max_pool = shared_layer(layers.Reshape((1, channel))(max_pool))
    max_pool = layers.Dense(channel, activation='sigmoid')(max_pool)

    cbam_feature = layers.add([avg_pool, max_pool])
    cbam_feature = layers.Reshape((1, 1, channel))(cbam_feature)
    return layers.multiply([input_feature, cbam_feature])

def spatial_attention(input_feature):
    kernel_size = 7
    avg_pool = layers.Lambda(lambda x: tf.reduce_mean(x, axis=-1, keepdims=True))(input_feature)
    max_pool = layers.Lambda(lambda x: tf.reduce_max(x, axis=-1, keepdims=True))(input_feature)
    concat = layers.Concatenate(axis=-1)([avg_pool, max_pool])
    cbam_feature = layers.Conv2D(1, kernel_size, padding='same', activation='sigmoid')(concat)
    return layers.multiply([input_feature, cbam_feature])

def conv_block_with_cbam(input, filters, kernel_size):
    x = layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size, padding='same')(input)
    x = layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = layers.Activation('relu')(x)
    x = channel_attention(x)
    x = spatial_attention(x)
    return x

input = layers.Input(shape=(224, 224, 3))
x = conv_block_with_cbam(input, 64, 3)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D(2)(x)
x = conv_block_with_cbam(x, 128, 3)
x = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
output = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

model = models.Model(inputs=input, outputs=output)
