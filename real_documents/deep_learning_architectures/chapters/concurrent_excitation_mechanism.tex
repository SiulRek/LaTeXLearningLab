\chapter{Concurrent Spatial and Channel Excitation Mechanism}

\section{Description}
The Concurrent Spatial and Channel Excitation (CSC) mechanism is a type of attention module in neural networks. It simultaneously focuses on the channel-wise and spatial features of the input data. This dual focus allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the features, leading to improved performance in tasks such as image classification and object detection.

\section{Python Implementation}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import tensorflow as tf

def channel_spatial_excitation_block(input_feature, ratio=8):
    # Channel Attention
    channel = input_feature.shape[-1]
    avg_pool = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(input_feature)
    avg_pool = layers.Dense(channel//ratio, activation='relu')(layers.Reshape((1, channel))(avg_pool))
    avg_pool = layers.Dense(channel, activation='sigmoid')(avg_pool)

    max_pool = layers.GlobalMaxPooling2D()(input_feature)
    max_pool = layers.Dense(channel//ratio, activation='relu')(layers.Reshape((1, channel))(max_pool))
    max_pool = layers.Dense(channel, activation='sigmoid')(max_pool)

    channel_excited = layers.add([avg_pool, max_pool])
    channel_excited = layers.Reshape((1, 1, channel))(channel_excited)

    # Spatial Attention
    avg_pool = layers.Lambda(lambda x: tf.reduce_mean(x, axis=-1, keepdims=True))(input_feature)
    max_pool = layers.Lambda(lambda x: tf.reduce_max(x, axis=-1, keepdims=True))(input_feature)
    spatial_excited = layers.Concatenate(axis=-1)([avg_pool, max_pool])
    spatial_excited = layers.Conv2D(1, kernel_size=7, padding='same', activation='sigmoid')(spatial_excited)

    # Concurrent Excitation
    combined_attention = layers.multiply([input_feature, channel_excited])
    combined_attention = layers.multiply([combined_attention, spatial_excited])

    return combined_attention

def csc_block(input, filters, kernel_size):
    x = layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size, padding='same')(input)
    x = layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = layers.Activation('relu')(x)
    x = channel_spatial_excitation_block(x)
    return x

input = layers.Input(shape=(224, 224, 3))
x = csc_block(input, 64, 3)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D(2)(x)
x = csc_block(x, 128, 3)
x = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
output = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

model = models.Model(inputs=input, outputs=output)
