\chapter{GoogLeNet (Inception v1)}

\section{Description}
GoogLeNet, also known as Inception v1, is a deep convolutional neural network architecture that achieved significant improvements in efficiency and computational cost. It's known for its 'Inception' modules, which use parallel convolutions of different sizes to extract information efficiently.

\section{Python Implementation}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def inception_module(filters):
    branch1 = layers.Conv2D(filters[0], kernel_size=1, activation='relu')

    branch2 = models.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(filters[1], kernel_size=1, activation='relu'),
        layers.Conv2D(filters[2], kernel_size=3, padding='same', activation='relu')
    ])

    branch3 = models.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(filters[3], kernel_size=1, activation='relu'),
        layers.Conv2D(filters[4], kernel_size=5, padding='same', activation='relu')
    ])

    branch4 = models.Sequential([
        layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=3, strides=1, padding='same'),
        layers.Conv2D(filters[5], kernel_size=1, activation='relu')
    ])

    return layers.Concatenate()([branch1, branch2, branch3, branch4])

model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(64, kernel_size=7, strides=2, padding='same', activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=3, strides=2),
    # Additional layers and Inception modules here
    inception_module([64, 96, 128, 16, 32, 32]),
    # More layers and Inception modules
    layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
    layers.Dense(1000, activation='softmax')
])
