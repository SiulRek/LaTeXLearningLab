\chapter{Xception}

\section{Description}
Xception is a deep learning architecture that modifies the Inception architecture by replacing the standard Inception modules with depthwise separable convolutions. This approach, known as "extreme Inception" (Xception), provides an efficient way to learn spatial and channel-wise features independently, leading to improved performance.

\section{Python Implementation}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def xception_block(input, num_filters):
    x = layers.SeparableConv2D(num_filters, 3, padding='same', activation='relu')(input)
    x = layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = layers.SeparableConv2D(num_filters, 3, padding='same', activation='relu')(x)
    x = layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = layers.MaxPooling2D(3, strides=2, padding='same')(x)

    residual = layers.Conv2D(num_filters, 1, strides=2, padding='same', activation='relu')(input)
    x = layers.add([x, residual])

    return x

input = layers.Input(shape=(299, 299, 3))
x = layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')(input)
x = layers.Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu')(x)
x = xception_block(x, 128)
x = xception_block(x, 256)
x = xception_block(x, 728)

# Additional Xception blocks would be added here

x = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
output = layers.Dense(1000, activation='softmax')(x)

model = models.Model(inputs=input, outputs=output)
\end{lstlisting}
