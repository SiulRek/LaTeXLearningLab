\section{Introduction to Document Formatting}
\label{sec:document-formatting}

Document formatting in LaTeX is predominantly automatic, but it offers great flexibility for customization. The layout, spacing, and structure are handled with predefined document classes and styles, yet can be easily adjusted to suit specific requirements.

\subsection{Automatic Formatting}
One of the key strengths of LaTeX is its ability to handle formatting automatically, allowing authors to concentrate on content rather than presentation.

\subsection{Customizing Layout}
Although LaTeX provides automatic formatting, it also allows for extensive customization to meet various publication standards and personal preferences.
