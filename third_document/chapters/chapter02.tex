\label{chap:basic-structures}

LaTeX is structured around the concept of document classes, which define the overall layout of documents. Additionally, it uses packages to extend its functionality.

\section{Document Classes}
A document class defines the overall layout of a document. Examples include article, report, book, and letter.

\section{Packages}
Packages in LaTeX are used to add extra functionality. For instance, the `graphicx` package is used to include images in the document.
