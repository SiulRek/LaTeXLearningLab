\chapter{Introduction to LaTeX}
\label{chap:intro}

LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation \cite{latexcompanion}. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents.

\section{History of LaTeX}
LaTeX was originally written in the early 1980s by Leslie Lamport at SRI International. It has become the most dominant method for using TeXâ€”much more so than plain TeX; most people never write in plain TeX anymore \cite{einstein}. The current version is LaTeX2e.

\section{The Philosophy of LaTeX}
LaTeX is based on the idea that authors should be able to focus on the content of what they are writing without being distracted by its visual presentation. This philosophy aligns with the principles of separation of content and style, as advocated by many computer scientists and typographers \cite{knuthwebsite}.
