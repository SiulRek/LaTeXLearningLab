    \frametitle{Concluding Remarks and Future Work}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The project demonstrated the effectiveness of polynomial regression and regularized models in predicting house prices.
        \item Polynomial features prevented from overfitting and improved model accuracy.
        \item Future work could explore more advanced machine learning techniques like ensemble methods or neural networks for better performance.
        \item Incorporating additional trend data, like housing market trends or demographic trends, could further refine predictions.
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Regression Models in Testing in Production}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ML regression models enhance production testing by predicting system behavior and potential failures.
        \item These models are critical for analyzing and interpreting large volumes of production data in real-time.
        \item The insights gained aid in proactive decision-making and troubleshooting, thus improving system performance and reliability.    \end{itemize}
